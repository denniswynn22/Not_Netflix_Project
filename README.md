1. Wireframe: Start by creating a well-designed wireframe that outlines the structure and layout of your website.

2. TMDB API Access: Utilize the TMDB API to access movie information. Make appropriate API calls to retrieve data for your project.

3. Landing Page: Create a landing page that displays "generic" information, including different movie sections such as "Trending" movies. Ensure that the relevant details of each movie are presented effectively.

4. Movie Cards: Render cards for each movie or show, displaying important details such as the movie title, synopsis, and poster image.

5. Search Function: Implement a search bar that allows users to search for movies by their titles. When a search is performed, display the corresponding movie cards.

6. Trailer Playback: Add a play button to each movie card. When clicked, it should play the trailer for the respective movie.
